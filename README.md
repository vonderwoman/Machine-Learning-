Machine Learning 

Machine learning is the art and science of programming computers to learn from the data. According to Arthur Samuel,1959 Machine learning is the study that gives computers the ability to learn without being programmed. For example writing a detection algorithm to notice some common word phases in the spam emails and the program would identify the E-Mail as spam if a number of patterns like the phases are detected. 

Another application of machine learning that has improved alot of peoples live is the speech recognition. Using the machine to write a program to distiguish between ‘one’ and ‘Two’. Ussually as a programmer you will notice these two words sound diffrent in a sense the ‘Two’ starts with ‘T’ the word is when pronounced has a high pitch,therefore you could train the model to identify the high pitch sound  and use that to differentiate from ‘One’. But again there is a disadvantage here, lets say  you are in a noisy sorrounding so, it will be hard for the machine to get the sound clear so the best recommendation would be to write an algorithm that simply learns from itself. 

In addition, machines has been abled to help human to learn, for example when a programmer writes a algorithm to classify spam emails, the model can be tested to see what they have learnt and for instances, when the machines  has been trained enough on the spam, it can produce lists of words and combinations that are fit to be classified as spam. Also the machine can give out new trends for better understanding of the problem. 

**We can say that machine learning is great for:**

-Finding patterns in our data that the humans could not spot 

-Adapting to new data sets 

**Types of Machine Learning** 

Supervised Learning 

In supervised learning, the training data you feed to the algorithm includes the desired solutions, called labels . 

Here are some of the most important supervised learning algorithms : 

 • k-Nearest Neighbors  

• Linear Regression  

• Logistic Regression  

• Support Vector Machines (SVMs)  

• Decision Trees and Random Forests  

• Neural networks2 


Unsupervised Learning 

In unsupervised learning, as you might guess, the training data is unlabeled.The system tries to learn without a teacher. 

Here are some of the most important unsupervised learning algorithms  

 • Clustering  

— K-Means 

 — DBSCAN  

— Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) 

• Anomaly detection and novelty detection  

— One-class SVM  

— Isolation Forest   

 • Association rule learning 

— Apriori  

— Eclat
